# URGENT: AWS KEY ROTATION REQUIRED

## **IMMEDIATE ACTION NEEDED**

Your AWS access key `dsfdfs` was found in local backup files and **MUST BE ROTATED IMMEDIATELY** for security.

---

## **Step-by-Step AWS Key Rotation**

### **1. Login to AWS Console**

```
https://console.aws.amazon.com/
```

### **2. Navigate to IAM**

- Go to **IAM** service
- Click **Users** in the left sidebar
- Find your user account

### **3. Disable/Delete Old Key**

- Click on your username
- Go to **Security credentials** tab
- Find access key: `sakfjhkfhal`
- Click **Actions** â†’ **Delete** (or **Make inactive** first to test)

### **4. Create New Keys (Optional)**

**ONLY if you plan to use AWS again in the future**

- Click **Create access key**
- Choose **CLI** or **Application** use case
- Download the new credentials
- **Store them securely** (NOT in code/git)

## **Why This is Critical**

1. **Local Exposure**: The key was in your backup files
2. **Billing Risk**: This key caused $129.95 in charges
3. **Security Best Practice**: Rotate exposed keys immediately

## **After Key Rotation**

1. **Monitor AWS billing** for any unexpected charges
2. **Set up cost alerts** for amounts > $1.00
3. **Review CloudTrail logs** to understand what caused the 12,995 API calls
4. **Keep using InfraSight safely** with mock data
